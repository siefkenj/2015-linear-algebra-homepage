		<h2>Homework</h2>
		<h3>Written Assignments</h3>
		<p>
			These assignments are to be done individually.  They do not need
			to be typed, but you may type them if you wish.

		<h3>Typed Assignments</h3>
		<p>
			These assignments are to be typed.  I suggested using the Latex
			typesetting language (more in the <a href="#latex">Latex</a> section.
			You may work in pairs on this assignment.  If you do so,
			both of your names should be included on the assignment and you
			should only turn in <i>one</i> copy of the assignment.  
			These assignments focus is clear communication.  You should aim
			to explain each problem as if you were explaining it to another
			student who hasn't seen the problems before (and as such, you should
			include necessary definitions, etc.)

		<h2>Latex</h2>
		<p>Latex is a programming language designed for typesetting documents.
		It was created (technically the base layer called Tex) by Donald Knuth 
		(considered one of the fathers of computer science).</p>
		<p>
		When you author a document in Latex, you write the content in a text
		file (ending in .tex) and then compile to a pdf.  The compiler 
		lays out all the words on the page and ensures all spacing, etc.
		is consistent.  This means on the one hand 
		that you won't see what your document will
		look like until you compile it, but you also will not need to do
		as much tweaking (as you might in a program like Microsoft Word)
		since the automatic layout algorithm latex uses is quite good
		(your textbook is written in Latex).
		</p>
		<h3>Getting Latex</h3>
		<p>
			You can either use an online version of Latex (which requires 
			no installations), or you can install Latex on your computer.
			I recommend starting with the online Latex distribution
			provided by ShareLaTeX 
			<a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">https://www.sharelatex.com/</a>.
			Sign up for a free account and get started!
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want Latex installed locally on your computer, you can
			install one of the Tex distributions for your operating system.
			For Windows, I recommend <a href="http://miktex.org/download">MiKTeX</a>;
			for Linux <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a> (which
			should be available through your package manager); and
			for Mac <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/downloading.html">Mac Tex</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<p>
			Here is an example file showing the type of
			math you might want to type in this course.
